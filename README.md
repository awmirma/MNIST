# MNIST Image Classification Project

This project is an implementation of a machine learning model for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow/Keras. The model is a simple feedforward neural network that achieves high accuracy in recognizing the digits.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional for visualization)

You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```
## Dataset
The MNIST dataset is already included in the TensorFlow/Keras library, so you don't need to download it separately.

## Running the Project
1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the Python script mnist_classification.py:

```bash
python mnist_classification.py
```
The script will load the dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, train it, and then evaluate its performance on the test set. The final accuracy will be displayed in the terminal.

4. (Optional) If you want to visualize the predictions for some test images, you can uncomment the relevant code in the script.

## Model Architecture
The model used for this project is a simple feedforward neural network with three layers:

1. Input Layer: A fully connected (dense) layer with 128 units and ReLU activation function.

2. Hidden Layer: Another fully connected layer with 64 units and ReLU activation function.

3. Output Layer: The final layer with 10 units (corresponding to the 10 digits) and a softmax activation function.

## Results
After training the model for 10 epochs, the accuracy on the test set is approximately 97.7%.

## Further Improvements
- Experiment with different model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to potentially improve accuracy.

- Try hyperparameter tuning to optimize the model's performance.

- Visualize the model's predictions on a larger set of test images to gain insights into its strengths and weaknesses.
